# TCGA Sarcoma Survival Analysis with Multi-Omics Integration
This project explores molecular subtypes in TCGA Sarcoma (SARC) patients using gene expression data and evaluates their association with survival outcomes. It also integrates microRNA expression, protein expression, and somatic mutation data to build a multi-omics survival model.

-  Identify molecular subtypes of sarcoma using unsupervised clustering of gene expression data
- Evaluate overall survival differences between identified subtypes using Kaplan-Meier and Cox models
- Integrate additional omics layers (miRNA, RPPA protein, somatic mutations) to enrich survival modeling
- Visualize results with dimensionality reduction, survival plots, and feature importance
